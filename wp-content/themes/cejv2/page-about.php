                    <p>My experience in web design and development so far has enlightened me to the frustration between Web Designers and Web Developers. Knowing how both worlds work is ESSENTIAL in streamlining the efficiency of a project and enhancing team synergy. Being able to communicate &amp; perform both design and programming means less confusion between expectation of the client and execution of the final product. It also means less time spent re-working designs that donâ€™t meet realistic programming needs. The product needs to function seamlessly so that clients BENEFIT from its qualities without frustration. I believe that with my perspective, skills, creativity and efficiency, I can help make that happen.</p>
