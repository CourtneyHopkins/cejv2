                            <p>Since May, I have been working as a front-end developer and custom wordpress theme developer for Convoy in Charlottesville, VA. Not only have I had the pleasure of working on a team to transform our designer’s custom web designs into custom WordPress themed websites, but I’ve also worked with clients to rethink large-scale web application workflow and user experience, create wireframes, and full web application designs.</p>

                            <p>In addition to my full-time job, I work with clients to create branding experiences, web designs and custom web development, specializing in custom WordPress theme and responsive development.</p>

                            <p>After my internship with Found, I came on for the summer as a full-time employee and the following fall / winter as part-time employee during school. I continued the work I did as an intern in addition to my integration into bigger, more involved projects in which I aided in programming, styling, bug fixing, and testing custom proprietary web applications and mobile apps for clients using Ruby on Rails, Titanium, HTML, CSS and Javascript. Projects include a custom pricing web application for Quality Structures Inc., a donation system with recurring billing functionality for Christian Aid Ministries, a custom e-commerce CMS for Christian Light Publications, a custom CMS online certification system for the Institute of Certified Professional Managers, and a shirt design, customization, and ordering iPad application for a local company called Moxie. We primarily host our applications on Heroku and Rails Playground.</p>

                            <p>I began working for Found as an intern for the spring semester of 2012 while I also attended James Madison University. As an intern I worked on creative web design and development projects individually as well as with a team, utilizing HTML, CSS and Javascript, on platforms such as Adobe Business Catalyst and WordPress. I also assisted with design work on multiple local company projects utilizing Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.</p>
